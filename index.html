      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </article>
    <p>I've had a love for technology since i was a child, always taking things apart and messing around with the internals, and what better way to dig into the internals of all things in this digital world then by learning to understand the code that makes everything tick.</p>
    <p>I recognize my place as a beginner in this field so i'm excited to connect with those more knowledgable than me, i aspire to learn from the best so that one day i may be as good. So if you have room in your team for an eager learner please feel free to contact me!</p>
    <p>Hopes of working in the gaming industry one day is what's started me down this path as i love the art form so if you have no need for a novice coder but want someone to carry you to top rank then it's a good thing nobody said my contact info was purely for professional use.</p>
